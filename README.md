# Health Disease Prediction System

Welcome! This project helps you predict the risk of Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinson's Disease using your health data. You do **not** need to be a technical person to use it.

---

## What is this?

This is a smart health assistant that uses machine learning to predict the risk of three diseases. You enter your health details, and the app gives you a risk assessment and health tips.

## How to Use (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Install Required Software

- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your computer. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 3. Install Project Requirements

- Open the folder in your computer.
- Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) in this folder.
- Run this command to install all required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the Application

- In the same terminal, run:

```
streamlit run app.py or python -m streamlit run app.py
```

- This will open a web page in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

### 5. Use the App

- On the left, choose which disease you want to check.
- Enter your health details in the form.
- Click the **Predict** button.

## For Jupyter Notebooks (Advanced)

If you want to explore the data or models, open the `.ipynb` files (like `heart.ipynb`) using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.
- If the app does not open, make sure you are in the correct folder and Python is installed.
